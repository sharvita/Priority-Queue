*  Description of the program
*******************************************************

The program takes in information from the file and stores
all the info into a queue to calculate the average wait
time that people spend in a store(I did a store instead
of a bank and I hope that's okay). There is a cashier(teller)
which takes care of the sales. There is a Directory class,
which keeps track of all the customers that came in and went,
which helped to calculate their wait time.
